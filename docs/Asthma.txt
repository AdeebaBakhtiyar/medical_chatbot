Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.
Causes
Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.
Asthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances called
allergens
or triggers, or by other causes.
Common asthma triggers include:
Animals (pet hair or dander)
Dust mites
Certain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])
Changes in weather (most often cold weather)
Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food
Physical activity
Mold
Pollen
Respiratory infections, such as the
common cold
and many other viruses
Strong emotions (stress)
Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked
Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to
occupational asthma
. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.
Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of
allergies
, such as hay fever (
allergic rhinitis
) or
eczema
. Others have no history of allergies.
Symptoms
Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.
Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom.
Symptoms of asthma include:
Cough
with or without sputum (phlegm) production
Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (
intercostal retractions
)
Shortness of breath
that gets worse with exercise or activity
Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe
Pain or tightness in the chest
Difficulty sleeping
Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in)
Emergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include:
Bluish color
to the lips and face (cyanosis)
Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack
Extreme
difficulty breathing
Rapid pulse
Severe
anxiety
due to shortness of breath
Sweating
Difficulty speaking
Breathing temporarily stops
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. The provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Allergy testing -- a
skin
test or a
blood test
to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances
Arterial blood gas
-- often done in people who are having a severe asthma attack
Chest x-ray
or CT scan of the chest -- to check for other conditions
Lung function tests
, including peak flow measurements
Treatment
The goals of treatment are to:
Control airway swelling
Limit exposure to substances that may trigger your symptoms
Help you to be able to do normal activities without having asthma symptoms
You and your provider should work as a team to manage your asthma symptoms. Follow your provider's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.
MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA
There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:
Long term or control medicines to help prevent attacks
Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks
LONG-TERM MEDICINES
These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.
Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you.
QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES
These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:
For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or during an asthma attack
Just before physical activity to help prevent asthma symptoms
Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control. Your provider may change the dose or your daily asthma control medicine to reduce the use of quick-relief medicines.
Quick-relief medicines include:
Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators
Oral corticosteroids for a severe asthma attack
A severe asthma attack requires a visit to a provider. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).
ASTHMA CARE AT HOME
You can take steps to decrease the possibility of asthma attacks:
Know the
asthma symptoms to watch for
.
Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.
Know which triggers
make your asthma worse and what to do when it happens.
Know how to care of your asthma
before and during physical activity or exercise
.
Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:
Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable
A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them
How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, what to do and when to call your provider
A
peak flow meter
is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.
It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.
Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack.
Outlook (Prognosis)
There is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. With proper self-care and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead a normal life.
Possible Complications
The complications of asthma can be severe, and may include:
Death
Decreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities
Lack of sleep due to nighttime symptoms
Permanent changes in the function of the lungs
Persistent cough
Trouble breathing that requires breathing assistance (ventilator)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if asthma symptoms develop.
Contact your provider right away if:
An asthma attack requires more medicine than recommended
Symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment
You have shortness of breath while talking
Your peak flow measurement is 50% to 80% of your personal best
Go to the emergency room right away if these symptoms occur:
Drowsiness or
confusion
Severe shortness of breath at rest
A peak flow measurement of less than 50% of your personal best
Severe
chest pain
Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis)
Extreme difficulty breathing
Rapid pulse
Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath
Prevention
You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways.
Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites.
Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly.
Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home.
Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold.
Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppings from cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks in some people.
If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating/air conditioning outlets in your home to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often.
Eliminate
tobacco smoke
from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to help someone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit.
Avoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible.
