Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.
Different types of anemia include:
Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency
Anemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiency
Anemia due to iron deficiency
Anemia of chronic disease
Hemolytic anemia
Idiopathic aplastic anemia
Megaloblastic anemia
Pernicious anemia
Sickle cell anemia
Thalassemia
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.
Causes
Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.
Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.
Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.
The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to:
Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example,
celiac disease
)
Poor diet
Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines
Possible causes of anemia include:
Iron deficiency
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Folate deficiency
Certain medicines
Destruction of red blood cells
earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems)
Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer,
ulcerative colitis
, or
rheumatoid arthritis
Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited
Pregnancy
Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma,
leukemia
, myelodysplasia,
multiple myeloma
, or
aplastic anemia
Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or
stomach ulcers
)
Sudden heavy blood loss
Symptoms
You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly. Symptoms that may occur first include:
Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise
Headaches
Problems concentrating or thinking
Irritability
Loss of appetite
Numbness and tingling of hands and feet
If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:
Blue color to the whites of the eyes
Brittle nails
Desire to eat ice or other non-food things (
pica
syndrome)
Lightheadedness when you stand up
Pale skin color
Shortness of breath
with mild activity or even at rest
Sore or inflamed tongue
Mouth ulcers
Abnormal or increased menstrual bleeding
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical examination, and may find:
A
heart murmur
Low blood pressure, especially when you stand up
Slight fever
Pale skin
Rapid heart rate
Some types of anemia may cause other findings on a physical exam.
Blood tests used to diagnose some common types of anemia may include:
Blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals
Complete blood count
Reticulocyte count
Other tests may be done to find medical problems that can cause anemia.
Treatment
Treatment should be directed at the cause of the anemia, and may include:
Blood transfusions
Corticosteroids or other medicines that suppress the immune system
Erythropoietin, a medicine that helps your bone marrow make more blood cells
Supplements of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, or other vitamins and minerals
Possible Complications
Severe anemia can cause low oxygen levels in vital organs such as the heart, and can lead to
heart failure
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have any symptoms of anemia or unusual bleeding.
